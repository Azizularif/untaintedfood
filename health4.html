Getting proper sleep can assist in your weight loss process. Yes i mean it. How? Lack of proper sleep triggers production of a hormones known as leptin and

ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. With a much greater appetite, one can be tempted to consume extra calories that may be harmful to your fat loss process.

muscles to repair and heal.

3). Eat Dinner Early.

Taking dinner right before bed converts the meal into fat directly because in sleep we are doing nothing to expend any calories. Plan to take dinner at least 4 hours before bed.

4). Do not Starve Yourself.

Starving often slows down metabolism as the body prepares for the next intake. This causes storage of fats especially in problematic areas like hips.

5). Eat Small Meals.

It’s recommended to take smaller portions of meals more often. Don’t skip all meals & indulge in a feast right before bedtime. This will lead to accumulation of fat.
